# Vowel Counter in Java

This is a simple Java program that takes a string input from the user and counts the number of vowels in it. The program is case-insensitive and only considers the English vowels: a, e, i, o, u.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts a string input from the user.
- Counts all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) regardless of case.
- Displays the total number of vowels.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program uses the following steps:

1. Takes input from the user.
2. Converts the string to lowercase to simplify comparison.
3. Iterates through each character and checks if it's a vowel.
4. Counts and displays the total number of vowels.
